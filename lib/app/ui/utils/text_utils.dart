Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition in which the force of blood against the walls of arteries is consistently too high. It is a common condition and is often referred to as a "silent killer" because it may not have noticeable symptoms until it has caused significant damage to the cardiovascular system.

Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is recorded as two numbers. The first number, systolic pressure, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pumps blood. The second number, diastolic pressure, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats.

In general, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg or below is considered normal. However, if the blood pressure consistently measures above this range, it may indicate hypertension.

Hypertension is a risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Treatment options for hypertension include lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, exercise, and a healthy diet, as well as medications to help lower blood pressure. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to manage hypertension and reduce the risk of related health problems.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, often has no noticeable symptoms, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a "silent killer." However, some people with hypertension may experience the following symptoms:

Headaches: High blood pressure can cause headaches, particularly at the back of the head and in the morning.

Dizziness or lightheadedness: Hypertension can cause dizziness or a feeling of lightheadedness, particularly when standing up quickly.

Blurred vision: High blood pressure can cause blurred vision or difficulty seeing.

Shortness of breath: Hypertension can cause shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity.

Chest pain: Hypertension can cause chest pain or discomfort, particularly during physical activity or emotional stress.

It is important to note that these symptoms are not specific to hypertension and can be caused by other conditions as well. The only way to know for sure if you have high blood pressure is to have it measured by a healthcare provider. If you have concerns about your blood pressure, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.

There are several lifestyle changes that can help prevent hypertension, or high blood pressure, from developing. Here are some tips:

Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing hypertension. Losing weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise can help lower your risk.

Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, can help lower your risk of developing hypertension.

Eat a healthy diet: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and low in saturated and trans fats, can help lower your risk of developing hypertension.

Limit salt intake: Consuming too much salt can raise blood pressure. Aim to limit your salt intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day.

Limit alcohol intake: Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure. Men should limit their alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day, and women should limit their alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day.

Quit smoking: Smoking can raise blood pressure and increase your risk of developing heart disease. If you smoke, quitting can help lower your risk of developing hypertension and other cardiovascular problems.

Manage stress: Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or talking with a therapist.

It's important to work with a healthcare provider to monitor your blood pressure and develop a personalized plan to prevent hypertension. Additionally, regular check-ups with your doctor can help detect and manage hypertension early.
